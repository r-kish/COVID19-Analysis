# COVID-19 Pandemic Statistical Analysis

The COVID-19 pandemic was declared on March 11th, 2020 and is currently ongoing, with cases appearing as early as October 2019.

The goal of this project was explore the statisical data provided by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) regarding COVID cases, deaths, and vaccinations, in order to encapsulate the COVID-19 pandemic into an easily understandable and interactive dashboard. Throughout this project, I was able to showcase my knowledge of SQL Queries for the purpose of cleaning and transforming data, then translating that into designing a usable dashboard with Tableau.

Data is extracted from the publicly accessible Our World in Data API for COVID-19 data. Date range is from January 2020 - December 2023. Datasets were cleaned using Microsoft SQL Server, with queries exported into Excel then loaded into Tableau for visualization.

You may view the finished, interactive dashboard on Tableau Public here: [COVID-19 Statistical Analysis Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/richard.kish/viz/SQLCovidDashboard_17107162902290/Dashboard1)
